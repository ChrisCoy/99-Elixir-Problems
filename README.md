# 99-Elixir-Problems

The goal is to solve the famous 99 lisp problems(originally in prologog), but in elixir, another functional language.
But my personal goal is to learn deeply the elixir language, learn the tricks and the behavior. So, probably i will not write clean code. I wanna know what i can, e what i cannot do, test all limits.

That said, feel free to open issue or pr to show me better ways to do something, or new tricks, i will appreciate it a lot ðŸ’œ.

## how to run

to run simply execute `mix start` on the terminal, for now it will run the last problem i was working on, you can change that on `lib/start.ex`
